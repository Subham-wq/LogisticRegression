# LogisticRegression
Sample code on how to apply Logistics Regression
Logistic regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1, which can then be converted into a binary decision using a predefined threshold.

The theory behind logistic regression is based on the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is defined as:
    sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
where z is the linear combination of input features and their respective coefficients:
       z = w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn
In logistic regression, the goal is to find the optimal values for the coefficients (w0, w1, ..., wn) that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This is typically achieved through a process called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or gradient descent optimization.

During training, logistic regression fits the model to the training data by minimizing a loss function, commonly known as the cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels. The coefficients are adjusted iteratively to minimize this loss, using techniques such as gradient descent or its variants.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class (1) or negative class (0). A threshold value is then applied to convert the probabilities into binary predictions. If the predicted probability is greater than the threshold, the instance is classified as the positive class; otherwise, it is classified as the negative class.
Logistic regression offers several advantages, including interpretability, simplicity, and computational efficiency. It can handle both continuous and categorical input features and can be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks through techniques such as one-vs-rest or softmax regression.

However, logistic regression makes the assumption that the relationship between the input features and the log-odds of the target variable is linear. In cases where the relationship is more complex, other models such as decision trees or neural networks may be more suitable.

In summary, logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks. By estimating the probabilities using the logistic function, it provides a robust framework for making predictions and can be applied to various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social sciences.
